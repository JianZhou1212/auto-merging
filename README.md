## Packages for running the code
To run the code you need to install:

**Pytope**: https://pypi.org/project/pytope/

**CasADi**: https://web.casadi.org/

**HSL Solver**: https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/coin-hsl

Note: Installing the HSL package can be a bit comprehensive, but the solvers just speed up the solutions. You can comment out the places where the HSL solver is used, and just use the default linear solver of CasADi.
